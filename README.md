<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

This is a school project at Hogeschool Leiden. We need to realise an application within ten weeks for our very first client. He wants an application where teachers can upload non-technical papers. Students are ablte to look into those and learn from them. "I do not want students to reinvent the wheel all the time over and over again", said our client.

These are the requirements:
* Only teachers are able to upload a non-technical paper
* Students can to look into those papers, without dommitting plagiarism
* We MUST use JavaFX (exam requirement)
* We also need to write everything in Java (exam requirement)

We are free to use any kind of library and styling option (Css, FXML, etc).

We also have a [back-end](https://github.com/Minnebro/Ipsen2-Back-End) for this project. This repository is mainly front-end.

### Built With
We used JavaFX for the front-end, Maven for easy dependency imports and Java as coding language. Jetbrains Intellij is our IDE.
